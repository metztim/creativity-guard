# Creativity Guard

A Chrome extension that helps you reduce dependency on AI tools by encouraging you to think for yourself first.

## What It Does

Creativity Guard shows a gentle reminder when you're about to use popular AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini, asking if you've taken a moment to think through the problem yourself first. It:

- Detects when you're about to use an AI assistant
- Shows a modal with a reminder to think first
- Provides a random suggestion for how to brainstorm
- Tracks stats on how often you think first vs. skipping right to AI

## Why Use This?

While AI tools are incredibly useful, they can sometimes reduce our ability to think creatively and solve problems on our own. This extension helps build a habit of independent thinking first, while still letting you access AI assistance when needed.

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`

4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension folder
5. The extension is now installed!

## Usage

1. Navigate to any supported AI website (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
2. When you focus on the input field, the modal will appear
3. If you've already thought about the problem, click "I did my own thinking: Proceed"
4. If not, consider taking a moment to think or click "Skip" to bypass the check
5. Click on the extension icon in your toolbar to view your stats
