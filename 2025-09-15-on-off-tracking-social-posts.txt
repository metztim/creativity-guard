> Don't make any changes, just want to explore possibilities:

  1. Is it possible to track how often the extension gets turned off (or on)?

  2. Would it be possible to post to Facebook, LinkedIn, X, and/or Slack a daily update of how often you've broken your focus "promise"?

⏺ I'll explore these possibilities for you without making any changes.

  1. Tracking Extension On/Off Events

  Yes, this is possible using Chrome's management API. You could:

  - Use chrome.management.onEnabled and chrome.management.onDisabled listeners in background.js
  - Store timestamps and counts in Chrome storage each time the extension is toggled
  - Track patterns like time of day, frequency, and duration of disabled periods

  The main limitation is that these events only fire while the extension is running, so you'd miss the "enabled" event if the user re-enables from Chrome's extension page.

  2. Daily Social Media Posts About Focus Breaks

  This is technically possible but requires additional setup:

  Facebook/LinkedIn/X (Twitter):
  - Would need OAuth authentication flow to get user tokens
  - Use their respective APIs (Graph API, LinkedIn API, Twitter API v2)
  - Schedule daily posts with stats like "I bypassed my creativity guard 3 times today"

  Slack:
  - Simpler - could use incoming webhooks or Slack app with OAuth
  - Post to a specific channel or DM yourself daily stats

  Implementation approach:
  - Add an options page for API configuration
  - Store encrypted tokens in Chrome storage
  - Use Chrome alarms API to trigger daily posts
  - Calculate stats from your existing creativityGuardStats

  The main challenges would be API rate limits, token management, and ensuring user privacy/consent for automated posting.

> Regarding point 1: do you mean we could track when it's turned off, but not when it's turned on?

⏺ No, actually the opposite! Let me clarify:

  While the extension is running (enabled):
  - ✅ Can detect when someone disables it - chrome.management.onDisabled fires
  - ✅ Can track this "I turned off the extension" event with timestamp

  While the extension is disabled:
  - ❌ Can't detect when someone re-enables it - the extension isn't running to listen
  - ❌ The chrome.management.onEnabled event fires, but there's no code running to catch it

  However, when re-enabled:
  - ✅ On startup, you could compare current time with last known active timestamp
  - ✅ Infer "I was disabled for X minutes/hours" and log that duration
  - ✅ Track patterns like "disabled 5 times this week for average of 2 hours"

  So you'd get:
  - Exact timestamps when disabled
  - Calculated durations when re-enabled
  - Running count of disable events
  - Patterns of when users typically disable (e.g., during work hours)

  This would give good insight into when users feel the need to bypass the extension entirely rather than just using the "bypass" button within it.
